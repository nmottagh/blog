I used to kid my vegetarian friends.

Fast forward to my early twenties, my dad lost a lengthy battle with cancer. I decided to buy a little conure for my mom to help her cope. What I had thought would just be a bird in a cage, turned out to be a tiny fully-flighted feathered friend with the intelligence of a 5-year-old.

One day, I was eating chicken in front of her — it felt weird. I wondered and then Googled “how are chickens raised.” This simple query sent me to a whirlwind of pages exposing the truth of factory farming.

That was the end of meat for me. I didn’t quit cold-turkey. I started cutting out an animal each year substituting plant-based alternatives. It took me four years to safely transition to a plant-based diet.

Meanwhile, I learned about nutrition. I learned about the negative impacts of factory farming on our planet. I learned about the consequences of eating factory farmed animals on my health.

I went vegan for animals but stayed vegan for me.

Looking back, **the hardest part of this transition was grappling with the notion of our collective ignorance and apathy.** I felt depressed every time I thought about what we are capable and tolerant of. Factory farming is barbaric. This is why some vegans are guarded, angry, and unfriendly. This is why some vegans come off as assholes. This is what gives veganism its bad rep.

I refused to give in to the idea that humans are cruel, apathetic, or ignorant. I firmly believe that **anyone exposed to the reality of factory farming would refute its practices**. In my books, except for a minority with mental health issues, everyone is a vegan at heart:

1. Some may be unaware of modern farming practices. They may not have ever thought about omnivorism or considered alternatives.
2. Some may have heard about factory farming but chosen not to explore further. They simply do not want to jeopardize their way of life or favorite dishes.
3. Some may be aware of the reality / consequences of modern factory farming practices. Others may not know where to start. Some may have tried to but eventually given up. After all, changing a diet is a significant undertaking and can even impact one’s health.

Veganism is not about a definition. It’s about compassion and kindness for all sentient beings. Instead of segregating, labeling, and judging, I want everyone to realize that at the core, we are all the same.

We would all condemn factory farming.

**Together, we need to empathize with everyone and help foster an environment where we can progress collectively through education, enablement, and technology to abolish factory farming once and for all.**

This should be our sole priority.
