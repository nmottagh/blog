My name is Naz. 

I am a computer engineer by training. After a few pivots, I now work as a product manager. In my spare time, I tinker with new tech and code for fun.

I am a parront to a little conure called Pixie. She is one of the reasons why I eat a plant-based diet and working hard to put an end to factory farming.

I'm always looking to connect so don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy reading!
